To run the Database, one needs to install the MongoDb Compass which offers a Graphic User Interface for displaying the information in a presentable manner. Another software that one needs is the visual code or the mongodb shell and extablish a connection between the visual studio and the mongodb compass.
In my case, i used the mongodb Shell in the compass to make interract and make necesaary changes to the changes.
The Mongodb compass does not require any additional configuration once it it is started. just create a database with the name PLP_week_one assignment and a collection name Books, and click on the shell at top-left corner
run the commands which are in the queries.js and the data should be displayed based on the instruction indicated in the comments.
